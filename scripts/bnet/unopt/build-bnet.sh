# Intended to be run from the chord-fork folder.
# Given a project name and a project path, runs the commands that must be run before driver.py can be invoked. This
# includes pruning the constraints in named_cons_all.txt, turning named_cons_all.txt.pruned into a bayesian network, and
# finally turning named-bnet.out into factor-graph.fg which is readable by driver.py.

# Arguments:
# 1. Project name, in a format recognized by list.sh, and eventually by runner.pl.
# 2. Project path, in a format recognized by list.sh, and eventually by runner.pl.
# 3. Augment dir: "augment" or "noaugment", suffixed with any string, in which the BN will be built.
#                 This will also indicate to prune-cons whether or not to augment the forward constraints while pruning.
#                 The second part of the name is merely a convention: it indicates the list of queries used as
#                 base_queries.txt while performing prune-cons.
#                 Ex: noaugment_or_thr means that prune-cons will not augment (because of the noaugment prefix) 
#                     and the BN will be placed in the directory noaugment_or_thr. The or_thr suffix indicates, again by
#                     convention, that the k-obj=3-sensitive oracle with thread escape was used as the set of queries to
#                     to be ranked.
# 4. rule-prob.txt, file mapping rule names to probabilities.
# 5. bnet dir: The chord_output folder that contains the named_cons_all.txt and in which the bnet should be built.
# 6. Name of the file containing the output tuples (ex. .../base_queries.txt) relative to the second argument above, i.e. project path. 
# 7. Optionally, "dolist", indicating whether to run list.sh. If supplied, list.sh is run to create the chord_output_*
#    directories. Otherwise, the chord_output directories from some previous run are used instead.
# 8. Optionally, "noprune", indicating whether to skip pruning named_cons_all.txt, and instead use a pre-existing
#    named_cons_all.txt.pruned file from a previous invocation of prune-cons.
# 9. Optionally, "oldbnet", indicating whether to use a pre-existing named-bnet.out from a previous invocation of
#    cons_all2bnet.py.
